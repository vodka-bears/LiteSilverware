This is a fork of Betafpv's LiteSilverware, a fork of NFE_Silverware. This fork is intended to be used only for Betafpv Lite Brushed V2. To build use Keil uVision. A free version will do. If you use gcc the firmware won't fit into STM32F042. To flash via USB frag hex file on top of flasher\flash.bat.
